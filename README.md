# ToDoList-Reminder
This repository consists of an android application using which the users can sign up, log in and create To-Do list of tasks/appointments/reminders on required date and time. Once the user creates the list, the user can just wave at the ‘Proximity Sensor’ present on the device to view the tasks that he/she should perform for next one hour. This functionality will be available always even when the application is closed, as long as the user is logged in.
